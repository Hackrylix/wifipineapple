Mobile Broadband requires a compatible USB 3G / 4G modem.

Connection is two phase. First the modem must be actived, then the network configuration sets paramaters used by pppd and gchat.
Since most 3G / 4G modems identify as CD-ROM or USB Storage devices an activation script, typically using usb_modeswitch or sdparm, is executed.
Activation forces the USB device to reveal its modem component.

The modem component is configured as a USB Serial device, typically /dev/ttyUSB0, which is addressed by the network configuration.
Network Configuration specifies the interface as WAN2. GSM and CDMA protocols are supported. ifconfig typically shows the interface as 3g-wan2.
The pppd is responsible for making the point-to-point connection with the USB Serial device. Configuration in /etc/ppp/options
Comgt is responsible for talking to the modem. EVDO and 3G (GSM) modem commands are specified in /etc/chatscripts/
For the most part neither of these files need modification.

Support outside of the listed supported modems is experimental, though help can be found on the Jasager forums. Most USB modems share similar 
configuration.

Updated 3G connection scripts with additional modem support can be found at wifipineapple.com
Additionally a 3G-KeepAlive script is available, which periodically checks for Internet connectivity and re-establishes if necessary.
This is done by attempting to send three pings to 8.8.8.8. If none are successful \"ifup wan\" is executed.",

<b>On the local host (this pineapple)</b>
 - Generate an RSA key pair. The private key will be stored in /etc/dropbear/id_rsa
 - Note the RSA public key presented above. You'll need the from \"ssh-rsa\" to \"root@Pineapple\"
 - Add the Clients ssh-rsa public key (not the public key above) to ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   - This is most easily accomplished by issuing 'ssh user@host' and pressing 'y' when prompted to save the key
   - This must be done interactively (via a shell on this device) as AutoSSH does not pass the '-y' option.

<b>On the remote host (the server)</b>
 - Append the above noted RSA public key to the authorized_keys file. This is typically located in ~/.ssh/
 - The following are helpful opensshd configuration options. The conf file is typically /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        AllowTcpForwarding   yes
        GatewayPorts         yes
        RSAAuthentication    yes
        PubkeyAuthentication yes

<b>Example Usage</b>

<b>Simple Relay Server</b>
With the above key exchange and SSH configuration complete create an SSH session through a relay server
 - Pineapple's SSH command: autossh -M 20000 -f -N -R 4255:localhost:22 user@relayserver -i /etc/dropbear/id_rsa
 - 3rd party SSH command: ssh pineappleuser@relayserver -p 4255
   - The pineapple user is typically root
   - If the relay server does not support remote port forwarding first SSH to the relay server as usual then:
     ssh pineappleuser@localhost -p 4255
